# Foxglove Studio Utils

This is useful for visualizing robot data from a robot on a laptop with a network connection to the robot.

## Installation (Laptop/Desktop)

The cleanest way to install is buy downloading the `.deb` package from the
[Foxglove Studio Downloads](https://foxglove.dev/downloads) page and installing
it with `sudo apt install ./<filename>.deb`.

When you install the `.deb` package, it will also install the `foxglove-studio` command line tool.
